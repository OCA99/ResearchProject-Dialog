# Dialog System Research

### Description

This is the dialog systems research task for the Project 2 course of the Video Game Design degree at CITM Barcelona. In this repository you will find information on dialog systems and a C++ implementation of a basic dialog system.

The objective of my work is to provide an easy and scalable solution for integrating written dialog into an RPG game. The provided solution includes an implementation of a dialog tree that allows for linear and forking paths, and provides a method to modify game state depending on the player's choices.
